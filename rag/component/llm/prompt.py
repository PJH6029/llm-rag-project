<question>
Can you describe the features of UTIL-1?
</question>

Answer:
### Answer
I can find the requirements for UTIL-1 in the document "Datacenter NVMe SSD Specification v2.0r21.pdf" and "datacenter-nvme-ssd-specification-v2-5-pdf.pdf". 
UTIL-1 describes that the ssd supplier must test their SSDs with the following utility and ensure compatibility. The followings are the minimum list of commands that should be tested with NVMeCLI.

- Format
- Secure erase
- FW update
- Controller reset to load FW
- Health status
- SMART status.
If you want to know more details, you can refer to the document "datacenter-nvme-ssd-specification-v2-5-pdf.pdf" page 170, which is the latest version of the document.

### Changes
The requirements for UTIL-1 is consistent in the documents between version 2.0r21 and 2.5.
The only difference is the section number, which is 16.1 in the document "Datacenter NVMe SSD Specification v2.0r21.pdf" and 18.1 in the document "datacenter-nvme-ssd-specification-v2-5-pdf.pdf".

However, the document "Datacenter_NVMe_SSD_Specification_v2.5_Addendum_v0.20.pdf" provides an updated list of commands to be tested with NVMeCLI.
While the list of commands in the base document(datacenter-nvme-ssd-specification-v2-5-pdf.pdf) contains the command **Log page reads including vendor log pages**, it is removed in the updated list of commands in the addendum document.
